## Introduction to Serverless Applications

### What Are Serverless Applications?

Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without managing the underlying infrastructure (like servers).

### Components of Serverless Applications

These components that make up a serverless application, likely including functions, APIs, storage, and other services provided by cloud platforms like AWS.

### Benefits of Serverless

Advantages of serverless architecture, such as cost savings and reduced operational complexity, since you don't need to maintain the servers.

## Real-World Example: Chat Application

### Building a Serverless Chat Application:

- build a chat application using serverless technologies

### Content Delivery

- To ensure fast and reliable content delivery, CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) service from AWS, will be used to distribute the static content globally.

### Backend Interaction

- For the backend, you'll use API Gateway to create RESTful APIs that will allow the frontend to communicate with the backend services. AWS Lambda will be used to run serverless functions that handle the logic for your chat application.

## Use Cases for Serverless Applications

### Dynamic, User-Interaction-Focused Applications

- Serverless architectures are particularly well-suited for applications that require dynamic, user-driven interactions, such as the chat application you're building.

### Not Ideal for Content-Heavy Websites

- It also points out the limitations of serverless applications, mentioning that they might not be the best fit for content-heavy websites where the serverless model may not offer significant advantages.
